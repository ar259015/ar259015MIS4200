        <h2>Hometown</h2>
        <p>
            I am from a small hometown, Findlay, Ohio. I went to Liberty-Benton Local schools and played varsity and club soccer.
            Findlay is a beautiful town with so much history and things to do.
            My Favorite part about Findlay is all the local food options. My favorite restraunt to go to is the Findlay Brewing Company.
